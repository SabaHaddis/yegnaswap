YegnaSwap is a local-first digital marketplace started by students in Addis Ababa. It is designed to help users sell second-hand items, promote homemade or DIY products, and offer local services like tutoring, hair braiding, printing, and more.

The startup was inspired by the everyday hustle on university campuses and in neighborhoods — where students and young people are already trading, selling, and promoting what they have or do. However, these exchanges were scattered across Telegram groups, word of mouth, and random links.

YegnaSwap solves this by offering a single, trusted space where anyone can post what they want to resell, swap, or offer — whether it’s a pair of shoes, a baked cake, or a tutoring service.

Core products:
1. Resell & Share – Post new or second-hand items for sale, swap, or giveaway.
2. Promote What You Make – Showcase handmade items like crafts, art, baked goods, or print designs.
3. Offer Your Services – Freelancers can list tutoring, hairdressing, sewing, editing, digital design, and more.

YegnaSwap was created to make local commerce easier, faster, and more trustworthy — especially for students, small creators, and side hustlers.

Mission: To connect people through what they have, make, or do.
Vision: To build a student-born, public-facing marketplace that grows into a trusted local ecosystem across Ethiopia and beyond.
